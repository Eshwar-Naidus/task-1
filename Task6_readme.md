# Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

[cite_start]This repository contains the solution for the AI & ML Internship Task 6 from Elevate Labs[cite: 1, 2].

## üéØ Objective

[cite_start]The goal was to understand and implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for a classification problem using the Iris dataset[cite: 4, 11].

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* Python
* [cite_start]Scikit-learn [cite: 4]
* [cite_start]Pandas [cite: 4]
* [cite_start]Matplotlib [cite: 4]
* NumPy

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

1.  [cite_start]**Load Data:** The Iris dataset was loaded directly from `sklearn.datasets`[cite: 11].
2.  [cite_start]**Normalize Features:** All features were standardized using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn[cite: 6]. This is crucial for KNN as it's a distance-based algorithm.
3.  **Train-Test Split:** The scaled dataset was split into 80% training data and 20% testing data.
4.  [cite_start]**Find Optimal K:** An "Elbow Method" plot was generated by training and testing the model on K values from 1 to 20[cite: 8]. The accuracy for each K was plotted to find the optimal value.
5.  [cite_start]**Train Final Model:** A `KNeighborsClassifier` was instantiated with the optimal K value and trained on the training data[cite: 7].
6.  **Evaluate Model:** The model's performance was evaluated on the test set using:
    * [cite_start]**Accuracy Score** [cite: 9]
    * [cite_start]**Confusion Matrix** [cite: 9]
    * **Classification Report**
7.  [cite_start]**Visualize Decision Boundaries:** To visualize how the model separates the classes, decision boundaries were plotted[cite: 10]. (Note: This visualization was done using only the first two features, Sepal Length and Sepal Width, for 2D plotting).

## üìä Results

* **Optimal K:** The elbow plot showed that K= [Your Optimal K Value, e.g., 7] provided the highest accuracy.
* **Accuracy:** The model achieved an accuracy of [Your Accuracy, e.g., 100%] on the test set.
* **Visualizations:**
    * **Elbow Method Plot:** Shows the accuracy for different K values.
    * **Decision Boundary Plot:** Visually confirms the model's classification regions for the three Iris species.
